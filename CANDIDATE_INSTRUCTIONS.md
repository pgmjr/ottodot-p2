# Welcome to Your Code Review Exercise! 👋

## What You're Looking At

This is a real module from a production Learning Management System (LMS) that's experiencing performance and reliability issues. Your job is to analyze it like you would on your first day as a developer joining the team.

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- **Code review**: 2-3 hours
- **Written answers**: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 3-5 hours

(No need to complete in one sitting - take your time!)

## 📖 Start Here

1. **Read the full `README.md`** - It contains all the context you need
2. **Run the application** locally to see the issues firsthand
3. **Review the code** starting with `pages/student/assignment/[id].tsx`
4. **Write your answers** to the three assessment questions

## 🎯 What We're Looking For

### Strong Answers Include:
✅ **Specific references** to files and line numbers
✅ **Root cause analysis** (not just symptoms)
✅ **Trade-off discussions** (why prioritize X over Y)
✅ **Measurable impact** (50% load time reduction, not "faster")
✅ **Clear communication** (explain like you're talking to a product manager)

### What to Avoid:
❌ Vague answers like "optimize the database"
❌ Over-engineering (don't suggest microservices for every problem)
❌ Ignoring real-world constraints (time, resources, existing architecture)
❌ Just listing issues without prioritization

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **The mock database simulates real issues** - Run the app multiple times to observe:
   - Varying load times
   - Occasional failures
   - Image loading problems

2. **Look for patterns, not just one-off issues** - We care more about systematic problems than individual bugs

3. **Consider**
   - What's the business impact?
   - What can ship this week vs this month?
   - How would you measure success?
   - What are the risks?

4. **Check the browser console** - The mock system logs simulated errors to help you identify issues

## 📝 Submission Format

Please submit a PDF document with:

### Required Sections:
1. **Question 1: Top 3 Concerns** 
2. **Question 2: One-Month Roadmap** 
3. **Question 3: Quick Wins** 

### Optional:
- Screenshots of issues you found
- Code snippets with annotations
- Diagrams if helpful

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Can I run the linter/formatter?**
A: Yes, but not required. We're more interested in your analysis than style fixes.

**Q: Should I fix the code?**
A: No - this is a **written analysis only**. We want to see how you think, not your coding skills.

**Q: Can I research solutions online?**
A: Absolutely! Real developers Google things. 

**Q: What if I find more than 3 concerns?**
A: Great! Mention them briefly, but focus your detailed analysis on the top 3.

**Q: How technical should my answers be?**
A: Write like you're explaining to a mix of engineers and product managers. Be technical but clear.

## 🆘 Stuck?

If you're having trouble:
1. Re-read the "Reported Issues" section in README.md
2. Look for code comments marked with `NOTE:` or `ISSUE:`
3. Check `SETUP_NOTES.md` for hints about intentional issues
4. Remember: There's no single "right" answer - we want to see YOUR thinking
